## Oskari Community Day 25.4.2019 in Helsinki

Remember to sign in: https://www.meetup.com/Oskari-Your-geospatial-friend/events/259264054/. 

Morning session is about Oskari use cases and on the afternoon there will be a mini hackfest were you can ask things from the developers or do bug fixes and other contributing actions. 

## News from the members

Jussi: 
- Oskari repo existing now at Helsinki, scripts available - Jussi will send the link in Gitter, still some finance issues to be tackled

Sami: 
- Map layer admin with React is being created: ES6 modules, named exports, testing how elements from the UI are being hidden
- Possibility with using React that you might end up with growing file structure because you can divide classes into smaller parts easier, this has to bee sorted out somehow
- Documentation has been improved and structure of the pages is being enhanced by creating better request descriptions and navigation. Bundel documentation is to be tied more tightly to functionalities.
- Also new bundle architecture is being implemented, take a look at  http://oskari.org/guides/modern-bundle  
- Styling libraries are being tested at the moment in NLS-Fi. Component level styles needs to be renewed due to changing to use React. CSS processing is still in use for old bundles, when most things are in React we will think about something else to get rid of Python dependency. Less, Stylus, etc. libraries are being checked by NLS-FI. Tests are conducted first and then OIP if something good is found.

Marko Kuosmanen: 
- HSY Oskari service has been updated with Jetty & Oskari 1.50

Marko Kauppi: 
- Tampere has a new authentication setup and tests are being made at the moment
- New download service is being created in Tampere - at the moment it is for Tampere use but could become a community bundle. It will have an Admin UI to help the adminstrators of the service. It will link downloadable files to WFS-interfaces, because e.g. drone images are still in file system and the amount of files is growing all the time. Download service will have a new UI for end users also.

Sanna: 
- Gispo & Ubigu will be helding Oskari training on 24.4.2019 at Helsinki (configuring Oskari setup from clean installation). Docker image was discussed for the training purpose. More info coming up soon.
- Sanna wanted to know is GeoNode a challenger for Oskari? GeoNode is being used in large multinational organisations and been integrated with QGIS also, so usage is probably growing. It was discussed that we could do an article on the differences between Oskari and GeoNode. Oskari is a map service which can produce new map services. GeoNode is a content management system. So they have slighlty different approaches. It was also seen crucial that companies would take Oskari as a tool and market it also globally. 

## New roadmap issues

## Other issues

- no other issues


## Next meeting

Next meeting: 9.4.2019, scheduled now every month, every second week tuesday at 13:00 (GMT+3)

## End of meeting: 13:56
