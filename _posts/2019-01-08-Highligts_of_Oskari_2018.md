# Highligts of Oskari in 2018

New Oskari community year starting, these were the highlights of Oskari in year 2018!

Not in any particular order, but here are 8 of the best things happened in Oskari community! Share yours in Twitter with @oskari_org.

1. Downloading data from Oskari became possible
Download basket offers the possibility to download datasets - first Oskari community bundle was released! With the download functionality you can select an area on the map based on free drawing or existing borders and download the chosen datasets that intersect the area. Download possibility is a community built plugin for Oskari and it has been taken in use in many Oskari instances.

2. Map layers are now in order
Oskari has now a core functionality which allows the possibility to provide hierarchies to map layers. And it is also the first ever tool in Oskari core that was created by several organisations' joint development efforts! Previously map layers could be handled only inside one theme, but now they can belong to several map hierarchies (like bicycling routes can be shown in "Tourism", "Sports" and "Networks" themes). Also the user interface was developed further to save space in the layer handling by adding the chosen layers into a separate tab.

3. Choropleth maps - you can do it!
Thematic maps is a core Oskari feature that has the ability to create choropleth maps from statistical interfaces. This tool among others was renewed in spring 2018 and it combines statistics and maps quite neatly. Now you can also create point symbol maps (proportional symbol maps) from statistical data related to areas. You can also view the data through bar charts and sort the attribute table more easier. The layout has been lightened so that the opening windows do not cover the maps as much as it did before.

At the same time the Time Series Tool and Terrain profile tools (WCS-service support) was taken in use.

4. Start crowdfunding Oskari
Oskari community wanted to start promoting crowdfunding for Oskari projects. Some of the needed Oskari tools are community inspired and might gain funding from several instances. Start your crowdfunding campaign today! Oskari community provides the process and helps you with the marketing.
