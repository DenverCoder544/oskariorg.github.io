# How easy it is to create your own Oskari API based map?

Jan Lindbom, the CPO/CTO in Sitowise Ltd explains to how to create a light weight map service with Oskari RPC.

## 1.  Access to Oskari

“You have to have access to a Oskari platform that offers this possibility,” he starts. So go to a service like [Paikkatietoikkuna](https://kartta.paikkatietoikkuna.fi/?lang=en), Suomi.fi-maps or similar. You can also try with [demo-site](https://demo.oskari.org/), but remember it will erase all saved information every day.

## 2. Sign in and create a published map

“You need to publish a map with Oskari's ready to use functionality with an easy to use web interface.” 
This can be done with signing in as a user, choosing a background maps or other available map layers and for example adding own your own data.

After adjusting the needed elements and tools to the map, publish and copy paste the iframe code to your website. 
 
##. 3. If you want to tailor it to your own needs

“And the last and most important part, you need to have application developer knowledge to be able to develop the integration to the other system by RPC. You need to know the system to which you are integrating at the technical level also.”

“ The advantage of using RPC is that the map interface can be easily integrated into a part of another system and make it work interactively”, Jan explains.
