this is something that could be interesting to other users

Sami:
- Jetty setup: conflicts with java have been resolved

(now can be found from contrib-side)
- Map layer admin with react and 3D issues hopefully coming up during fall 2019. 
3D in published map is done already for Paikkatietoikkuna, coming to Oskari 
(same issues as in Arctic SDI, where they used multiple projections, now we could utilize these features for applying 3D in published maps).
