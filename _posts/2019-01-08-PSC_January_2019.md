## Last meeting topics and follow-up

New Oskari 1.49 and 1.50 were released in December. Sami will inform Oskari mailing list about the 1.50.

Jetty 9 installation going on at the moment in different setups in NLS-FI.

Website development has received 5000€ funding from JDF. It was discussed that the possible different solutions should be checked (readthedocs, mkdocs, WordPress/GitHub integration like https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/using-git-wordpress/). E.g. GeoNode uses documentation from GitHub: http://docs.geonode.org/en/latest/index.html   

Statistics Finland Oskari instance is being updated to 1.49 version, update of the user guide coming up soon.

Suomi.fi maps roadmap is under way but no concrete issues yet available.


## News from the members

Hafliði: Oskari upgrading should be done for the NLS-IS in the spring. People are interested in the statistics part and there is a pressure to have this up and running.

Jaakko: No Oskari related news. Willing to drop out from PSC due to change of work place. This was approved.

Jussi: 

-I have done Oskari doccer chek-ups - installation instruction have been checked, does Jetty some how change the installation? Sami: Yes, it is a bit different. Installation documentation has been updated - Jussi promised to test this. 
-Also Jussi has done INSPIRE metadata inspection with Helsinki metadata - hopefully something to show in the future. Geonode uses http://pycsw.org for metadata to convert own metadata to OGC metadata, CKAN etc.

Marko Kauppi: Oskari migration is being done for Tampere at the moment, current authentication SAML environment.

Marko Kuosmanen: Liikennevirasto jetty 9 upgrade on going. NBA Oskari 1.49 update, Liiteri 1.49 upgrade coming and also hierarchical layerlist.

Timo: updating installation scripts and pipelines for Suomi.fi maps. Suomi.fi maps roadmap is being updated and the list is quite long. Planning to have input round for customers. Most issues are already in Oskari roadmap, maybe some new issues are going to be common. 

Tuuli: nothing to add to the previous, no publication date available yet for the Statistics Finland Oskari installation.

Tomi: We had internal workshop in December for HSY Oskari development. Version upgrades and small improvements (visual fixes) coming up. There are many projects in HSY using OSkari and RPC use is growing this year. HSY is working with Sitowise to achieve these. Many small improvements are still waiting. Some of the ideas could be also valuable for the Oskari community. We need a process to get those ideas to GitHub. Timo will talk to HSY people about this.

Sami: 

- New Jetty 9 servers are installed. 
- New version of RPC client just came up. It has a helper console for react-based apps. Document found from the RPC repo. 
- We are testing how to create Vector tiles from WFS (big development). Transport app, possibility to connect to a complex WFS - selling point for Oskari. Demosite were you can test complex WFS and vector tiles: https://demo-kartta.paikkatietoikkuna.fi/?uuid=1e03a73e-a50e-41fd-b3c0-9bd5b3dafe35 

## New roadmap issues

- Improvement of the documentation site https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-docs/issues/82 was approved

## Other issues

Highlights in 2018:
https://verkosto.oskari.org/en/highlights-in-oskari-community-in-2018/ 
New Thematic maps functionality - it could be listed also (let’s add this, Sanna has to do an article about it first).

2019 biggest steps for Oskari
- Plans for 3D map engine
- Vector tiles
- My places & user layers merge (possibly)
- More and more react bundles
