## New roadmap issues

Layer external info url and description: oskariorg/oskari-docs#96 was discussed and there was some reservations about does this need to be part of Oskari and should Oskari be more of a content management system. It was decided that this all PSC members should go through the proposal and it is to be voted upon that. Due date for decisition is 26th of February.
 

## Other issues

- Gitter has been active, which is nice! Rocketchat PSC channel has been removed permanently.
