Clone the repository  
`https://github.com/nls-oskari/nls-oskari.github.io.git`

If you want to run this in your own browser you need to install [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) `2.2` or higher.  
You also need to install the bundler gem: `gem install bundler`  

Then cd into the projects root folder and run `bundle install`.  
After everything is done run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to view the site in browser at `localhost:4000`.
